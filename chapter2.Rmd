# Abstract

<!-- The Abstract is perhaps the most important paragraph in a paper. Avoid writing it as a mere summary of the research. Place key results in the abstract’s first two sentences – don't bury the lede. Do not include lists of common methods, discursive explanations of what you set out to accomplish, or citations. Use the abstract and title to highlight the paper’s keywords. Maximum word count is 350.  -->

In eastern North America, grassland birds are under severe threat from habitat loss and agricultural intensification.
Protected areas such as public lands and conservation easements are important tools to protect biodiversity, but their relative effectiveness for grassland birds in this region is less well known.
To assess whether public lands safeguard grassland bird diversity, we combined data from two grassland bird monitoring programs: the National Park Service National Capital Region Inventory & Monitoring Network and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's Virginia Working Landscapes program.
From breeding-season point count surveys in Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia from 2012-2022, we compared richness, abundance, and diversity of 22 obligate and facultative grassland bird species among protected publicly-owned lands, privately-owned conservation easements, and unprotected private lands.
We found that richness did not differ among land ownership types, but abundance and diversity were lower on public lands.
Grassland points surveyed on public lands were also surrounded by more development and more isolated from surrounding protected land types than points on protected or unprotected private lands.
We did not find any community metric to be higher on unprotected private lands than on privately-owned easements.
The best predictor of grassland obligate abundance was grassland within 500 m.
These results suggest that local habitat management can overcome the differences between public and private lands, meaning partnerships between public and private lands will be key to conserving grassland birds.

<!-- This section provides your research aims and significance and places it within the framework of the existing literature. The last Introduction paragraph typically provides the study’s hypotheses and testable predictions. Use citations judiciously; most points can be supported by three or fewer citations. Long lists of citations are seldom required and detract from the readability of the manuscript. -->

<!-- Biodiversity decline -->

Biodiversity loss is a pressing global issue driven by human modification of ecosystems, including habitat loss and degradation.
The expansion and intensification of agriculture are major contributors to biodiversity loss worldwide [@maxwell2016].
In North America, these factors have contributed to precipitous declines of birds that rely on grassland habitats [@stanton2018; @hill2014], with a 53% decrease in populations of these species since 1970 [@rosenberg2019].
The collapse of grassland bird populations has been particularly dramatic in the eastern US [@sauer2017], largely caused by the loss of pasture and remaining historical grasslands to afforestation, development, and intensive agriculture [@brennan2005].
These declines have made this guild a high priority for conservation efforts [@brennan2005], with grassland bird species commonly threatened or endangered in the east [@vickery1991].

<!-- Protected areas -->

Protected areas, lands that are protected from development and managed to preserve biodiversity along with other natural, recreational and cultural purposes [@pad], may be key to maintaining biodiversity into the Anthropocene [@palomo2014].
Management goals and approaches vary considerably among publicly-held lands (hereafter public lands) by ownership (e.g. National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Forest Service, etc.) and among privately-held conservation easements (hereafter easements), including the degree to which they are managed for biodiversity.
One common goal in the establishment of protected areas, both public lands and easements, is to protect habitats from degradation [@watson2014].
For example, protected areas can be insulated from, though not immune to, surrounding land-use changes [@andam2008] and resulting noise and light pollution [@buxton2017].
Within human-dominated landscape, insulation from human development and impacts can create a safeguarding effect where bird species show better long-term population growth rates inside protected areas compared to surrounding areas [@dettling2021].
In recognition of the benefits of protected areas, the Convention on Biological Diversity has recently reaffirmed a goal of 30% of all land area protected by 2030 in order to halt biodiversity loss [@cbd], although its recommended goals have not been met in the past [@watson2014].

Although important, existing protected areas face a variety of challenges to their ability to conserve biodiversity, including that they are limited in the extent to which they include all native habitat types.
Consequently, grassland birds are under-represented in protected areas [@alexander2017; @grand2019] and this is reflected in assessments of bird populations in protected areas in the eastern US that have focused mainly on forest species as indicators of ecosystem health [@canterbury2000; @goodwin2014; @oconnell1998].
Public lands also face management challenges that can impede the conservation of grassland birds.
For example, financial support for public lands has stagnated in the US in recent decades, leading to large management backlogs [@watson2014].
These backlogs can be particularly important in managing ephemeral grasslands that can require annual to biannual disturbance via prescribed fire, mowing, or grazing to remain suitable habitat for species of concern [@hunter2001].

<!-- Private areas, esp for grasslands -->

Private lands are also considered important for conservation of biodiversity.
In the eastern US, 85% of land is privately-owned [@rasker2019], and given that roughly 52% of all land area in the US is used for agricultural production [@usdaers], integrated conservation planning for grassland birds will necessarily rely on private agricultural lands [@atwood2017].
Even small patches of grassland within an agricultural or urbanized matrix can be beneficial to grassland bird populations when they are managed with bird conservation in mind [@weidman2011].
However, unprotected private land management can degrade grassland habitat through overgrazing or conversion to row crops [@with2008] when it is not managed with biodiversity as a goal.

<!-- Tighten up this paragraph -->

Meeting both human and biodiversity needs will require integration of agricultural and conservation goals on agricultural lands [@kremen2018].
Conserving biodiversity does not necessarily have to come at the expense of agricultural production.
Privately-owned, unprotected agricultural lands can have the same bird community composition as protected areas, though this effect has been shown most strongly in agroforestry [@karp2019].
Combining wildlife-friendly farming techniques with yield-increasing and land-sparing measures can result in both high crop yield and high densities of species that depend on these lands [@green2005].
Individual management decisions on unprotected working lands, often motivated by the need for yield and annual fluctuations in climate, have the power to impact bird populations positively and negatively at a regional scale [@allen2021].
However, management practices that favor grassland birds are often more expensive because of decreased area under cultivation or fewer harvests per year, leading to lack of widespread adoption by private landowners [@atwood2017; @troy2005].

Conservation easements, voluntary legal agreements that protect land, are one strategy to promote wildlife-friendly land use on private lands.
On agricultural lands, these programs can involve voluntary agreements or payments for landowners setting aside land from production or delaying hay harvests, which allows more grassland birds to fledge but reduces hay yield [@gruntorad2021; @bollinger1990].
Some forms of easement can protect grassland habitat from conversion to degrading land use such as intensive agriculture or development [@claassen2017].

Although they are privately-held, conservation easements can equal or exceed public lands in ecosystem services, including biodiversity conservation [@villamagna2015]. 
Examples of easements include the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a Maryland permanent extension of the US Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program aimed at agricultural lands, or the Virginia Outdoors Foundation's conservation easements.
A large body of research demonstrates that easements can host high populations of regionally declining grassland species [@johnson1993; @johnson1993a; @ribic2009a; @herkert2009].
Easements on private lands can even outperform public lands and unprotected private lands for grassland birds abundance [@best1997; @cunningham2005; @ahlering2019] and diversity [@cunningham2005].

<!-- Local to regional indicators for grassland health -->

Conservation measures such as easement enrollment, cost-share practices, and grassland restoration can impact grassland bird populations at local [@allen2019], regional [@allen2021], and landscape scales [@pavlackyjr.2022; @veech2006].
However, landscape context can mitigate the conservation value of protected areas [@rayner2013].
If grassland bird populations are positively impacted by land protections in the surrounding landscape, then the creation and maintenance of protected areas could have wide-reaching benefits.
There are many potential scales over which land use and land protection could impact grassland bird communities, so it is crucial to determine the spatial scale at which communities respond most strongly to protections [@miguet2016].

To evaluate the relative contributions of public lands, private easements, and unprotected private lands at local and regional scales for grassland bird conservation in Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, we evaluated data collected through two long-term breeding grassland bird monitoring projects.
We applied these data to test the hypothesis that land protections safeguard grassland bird diversity in this region.
The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program (NPS I&M) monitors natural resources within parks to inform manager decision-making [@nationalparkservice2005] and has been monitoring grassland birds on four national battlefield parks since 2014.
Virginia Working Landscapes (VWL), a Smithsonian-led research program, has trained and deployed community scientists to monitor grassland bird communities on private lands in Virginia since 2012 (www.vaworkinglandscapes.org).
We predicted that (1) surveyed grasslands within private easements and public lands would have similar grassland species richness, abundance, and diversity, (2) that these metrics would be higher within public lands and private easements relative to unprotected private lands, and that (3) increased urbanization in the surrounding landscape would have a negative impact on grassland bird abundance within private unprotected lands, but not within public lands.

This area is part of the Mid-Atlantic region, which is primarily a mix of forest, agriculture, and development with increasing urbanization and development in recent decades [@slonecker2010].
Although the east coast was historically densely forested, grassland birds have always existed in the landscape through geological features with poor soils (e.g. serpentine grasslands) alongside disturbances produced by wildfire, beaver activity, and Native American land management [@askins1999].
Modern habitats for grassland birds in this region include working lands such as pasture and hayfields, military lands, natural and managed meadows, and abandoned farm fields, among others.
The total availability of these habitats may be declining in the Mid-Atlantic, however, as percent cover of agricultural land decreased by 4.5% from 1973 to 2001, with afforestation strongly associated with reduced agricultural cover [@slonecker2010].

## Data collection

### Bird surveys
We pooled data from two breeding-season bird monitoring programs conducted concurrently within the same region (Figure \@ref(fig:map)).
The NPS I&M has collected forest bird occurrence and abundance data in the National Capital Region since 2007 [@nationalparkservice2005] and initiated complementary long-term population monitoring for grassland birds in 2014 within four national battlefield parks.
Surveys by NPS I&M occurred between 2014-2019 and in 2021 at 242 points on four national battlefield parks in northern Virginia, central Maryland, and eastern West Virginia.
Virginia Working Landscapes conducted surveys of grassland birds on a mix of public and private lands throughout the region from 2012 to 2022. This data set consisted of surveys at 518 points on 140 properties.
Between the two datasets, trained observers conducted surveys on `r n_distinct(points$point_id)` points among `r n_distinct(points$property_id)` properties varying in size from 10.4 acres to nearly 200,000 acres (Shenandoah National Park).
These included a variety of locations on private lands, both protected by easements and unprotected, as well as public lands including state parks, national parks, state natural area preserves, and local battlefield parks, among others.
Both programs conducted surveys at Manassas National Battlefield Park in Manassas, Virginia, but otherwise they did not overlap spatially.
Point counts occurred each year with NPS, ranging from 3-7 years consecutive years of surveys, while VWL points were typically surveyed in a single year, through some were visited during as many as three years.
Properties surveyed by NPS were larger (mean area: 1,065 ha) and more heavily surveyed (range: 29-100 points per property), while VWL-surveyed properties were smaller on average (mean area: 271 ha) with fewer total surveys (range: 1-21 points per property).
Each surveyed property contained 3 or more points located at least 200 m apart.

Survey methodologies were consistent between the two programs, which allowed us to combine them.
Surveys consisted of a 10-minute point count conducted by a single observer (though VWL surveys also typically had a non-observer scribe present) from 30 minutes before sunrise until 5 hours after sunrise.
Observers performed a fixed-radius count, recording all individual birds within 100 m at the time and distance of first detection.
Birds observed outside of this time and distance window were designated as incidentals and were excluded from analysis.

### Landscape characteristics

We used the USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States version 3.0 [@pad] to assign each survey point a classification as public land (overlapped a protected area owned by federal, state, or local government, or an NGO), private easement (overlapped a protected area that was owned privately), or private unprotected (did not overlap any protected areas).
To examine the impact of land cover and protected area cover at multiple spatial scales, for each survey location we extracted the proportion of protected area coverage and the proportion of several land cover types [@nlcd2019] at buffer radii ranging from 200 m to 8 km.
We reclassified land cover [@johnson2017] into the following categories: forest (consisting of deciduous, evergreen, mixed forest, and woody wetlands), grassland (shrub/scrub, grassland/herbaceous, and pasture/hay), and developed (consisting of low, medium, and high-intensity urban cover).
These land cover types are known to have impacts on grassland species [@irvin2013; @buxton2016].
We also calculated the acreage of the property on which points were located using NPS park boundary polygons or the acreage as included in the VWL database.

## Analysis

We classified species as obligate and facultative grassland-breeders following @vickery1999 (Table \@ref(tab:species)).
We calculated average abundance per survey of facultative and obligate grassland species.
We calculated mean annual grassland species richness by point.
To prevent differences in sampling intensity from influencing richness and diversity, we used only 3 visits per point (selecting randomly from all visits that year) and did not pool data across years because points in the NPS data set would have inevitably had a higher richness due to singleton rarities accumulated over multiple years of surveys at each point.
As a result, we calculated metrics as an average across all years the point was surveyed.
We also randomly thinned the data to a maximum of 30 points per site (min = 3, max = 30, mean = 6.1) within each property to prevent the more intensively-sampled NPS properties from skewing the mean among other public lands.
We calculated the Shannon index $H=-\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_ilnp_i$ where *S* is the species richness and *p~i~* is the relative frequency of species *i* (commonly referred to as diversity, but see @jost2006) of grassland species in each ownership type using the R package vegan [@oksanen2022].
We took the exponential of the Shannon index to get a true measure of diversity, Hill number, which is the effective number of species [@jost2006].
The advantage of Hill numbers is that they can be compared in real units and obey an intuitive doubling property that accurately reflects proportional differences in assemblies [@chao2014].
We compared abundance, richness, and diversity among ownership types using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
With significant ANOVA results (*P*\<0.05), we performed Tukey post-hoc pairwise comparisons.

To determine the comparative impact of land cover and land protection on grassland birds, we modeled mean abundance of all grassland obligates as a function of proportion surrounding land cover and ownership.
We included both ownership at the point location and the proportion of surrounding protected land, because points on unprotected lands might benefit from nearby protected areas.
We first determined the scale of effect for each land cover type by performing linear regressions with mean abundance of obligates as a function of proportion land cover at each radius.
The scale of effect for this approach was considered the radius that maximized log-likelihood of the model [@fletcher2018].
Additionally, we used an approach modified from @irvin2013 in which we considered the scale of effect to be the scale with the highest absolute value of the model estimate, indicating the strongest slope of considered models.
If these two methods did not agree, we preferred the log-likelihood approach.
We next used the scale of effect for each land cover type in subsequent models that included land cover types, ownership, and area.
We ranked models using Akaike's information criteria AIC [@akaike1974], comparing to a static null model and one with only land ownership.
To investigate the safeguarding effect of public lands, we also investigated whether ownership type had an interactive effect with the impact of development.
All analyses were performed using program R version 4.2.3 [@rcoreteam2023].

```

The surrounding landscape differed between locations on public and private land, but generally not between unprotected private lands and private easements.
Points located within public lands and easements had inherently higher proportion of surrounding protected area (50-100%) at the smallest spatial scales due to their placement within such protected areas (i.e. public lands and easements; Figure \@ref(fig:protradius)).
However, at the largest spatial scales, points within public lands were not surrounded by as much protection.
The proportion of protected area within 8 km differed by land ownership type (*F~(`r aov_protected$df[[1]]`,`r aov_protected$df[[2]]`)~* = `r round(aov_protected$statistic[1], 1)`, *P* `r if_else(aov_protected$p.value[[1]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", paste("=", as.character(round(aov_protected$p.value[[1]], 2))))`).
At this scale, points on public lands were surrounded by less protected area than those on private easements (*P* `r if_else(aov_protected_tukey[[2, 7]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", paste("=", as.character(round(aov_protected_tukey[[2, 7]], 2))))`) or private unprotected lands (*P* `r if_else(aov_protected_tukey[[3, 7]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", paste("=", as.character(round(aov_protected_tukey[[3, 7]], 2))))`).
The three ownership types also showed significant differences in local habitat (*F~(`r aov_protected$df[[1]]`,`r aov_protected$df[[2]]`)~* = 62.3, *P* \< 0.001).
In all cases, private easements and private unprotected lands did not differ (*P* \> 0.05).
At the point scale (i.e. within 250 m, the smallest scale measured), public lands were surrounded by a lower proportion of grassland on average than either type of private land, with a mean difference of 0.19 (*P* \< 0.001).
Points on public lands were also surrounded by a significantly higher proportion of developed area than private lands (*P* \< 0.05), though the magnitude of difference was small at 0.03.
Forest cover within 250 m did not differ among ownership types (*F~(2,757)~* = 1.6, *P* = 0.2).

## Avian richness, abundance, diversity

Grassland bird communities varied by land ownership.
While public lands had slightly higher total grassland species richness (21 spp.) than private easements (19 spp.) or private unprotected land (17 spp.), mean annual richness per point (standardized for effort at 3 surveys per point per year) of all grassland species did not differ significantly by landowner type (*F~(`r aov_rich_combined$df[[1]]`,`r aov_rich_combined$df[[2]]`)~* = `r round(aov_rich_combined$statistic[1], 1)`, *P* = `r if_else(aov_rich_combined$p.value[[1]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", as.character(round(aov_rich_combined$p.value[[1]], 2)))`; Figure \@ref(fig:richptyr)).
Mean annual richness also did not differ for obligate (*P* = `r if_else(aov_rich_ob$p.value[[1]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", as.character(round(aov_rich_ob$p.value[[1]], 2)))`) or facultative (*P* = `r if_else(aov_rich_fac$p.value[[1]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", as.character(round(aov_rich_fac$p.value[[1]], 2)))`) species when considered alone.
Mean annual richness of non-grassland species, defined as any species not classified as an obligate or facultative grassland bird, was significantly higher on public lands (13 spp.) than on private easements (9 spp.) or private unprotected lands (9 spp.; *F~(`r aov_rich_forest$df[[1]]`,`r aov_rich_forest$df[[2]]`)~* = `r round(aov_rich_forest$statistic[1], 1)`, *P* `r if_else(aov_rich_forest$p.value[[1]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", paste("=", as.character(round(aov_rich_forest$p.value[[1]], 2))))`).

Mean abundance varied by species and land ownership, with the most abundant obligates across all landowner types being Grasshopper Sparrow *Ammodramus savannarum* (`r plot_abund_data %>% filter(species == "GRSP") %>% pull(mean_birds_surv) %>% max() %>% round(2)` individuals per survey) and Eastern Meadowlark *Sturnella magna* (`r plot_abund_data %>% filter(species == "EAME") %>% pull(mean_birds_surv) %>% max() %>% round(2)` individuals per survey).
Together, these two species made up 33% of all individual grassland birds that were detected.
Certain species (Loggerhead Shrike [*Lanius ludovicianus*], Northern Harrier [*Circus hudsonius*], Mallard [*Anas platyrhynchos*], and Dickcissel [*Spiza americana*]) were so rare that \< 20 individuals were observed across more than 6,000 surveys.
Land ownership had a significant impact on abundance in 15 of 22 grassland species (Figure \@ref(fig:abundbysurvey)).
Abundance on public lands was significantly lower than on private lands for 9 of 22 species, as well as for grassland birds as a whole (*P* \< 0.05).
Among obligates, only Grasshopper Sparrow, Horned Lark (*Eremophila alpestris*), and Vesper Sparrow (*Pooecetes gramineus*) were more abundant on public lands.
Easements had higher abundance than private unprotected lands for Common Yellowthroat (*Geothylpis trichas*, facultative), American Kestrel (*Falco sparverius*, facultative), and Savannah Sparrow (*Passerculus sandwichensis*, obligate).
Only one species, Red-winged Blackbird (*Agelaius phoeniceus*, facultative), was most abundant on private unprotected lands.

Diversity as both Shannon index and Hill number differed by land ownership type (Shannon index: *F~(`r aov_diversity$df[[1]]`,`r aov_diversity$df[[2]]`)~* = `r round(aov_diversity$statistic[1], 1)`, *P* `r if_else(aov_diversity$p.value[[1]] < 0.001, "< 0.001", paste("=", as.character(round(aov_diversity$p.value[[1]], 2))))`, Figure \@ref(fig:diversity)).
Private easements and private unprotected land were similar, both with a mean of `r data_summary |> filter(owner == "Private easement") |> pull(hill_mean) |> round(2)` effective grassland species (*P* = `r tukey_diversity |> filter(contrast == "Private unprotected-Private easement") |> pull(adj.p.value) |> round(2)`).
Shannon index and effective number of species were both lower on public lands (*P* \< 0.001); however, the magnitude of this difference was small, a difference of only `r tukey_diversity |> filter(contrast == "Public-Private easement") |> pull(estimate) |> abs() |> round(2)` effective species on average.

## Land cover models

The buffer radius we chose to be the scale of effect for land cover differed slightly between methodological approaches.
The scale of effect for the proportion of cropland in the surrounding area was 2.25 km (4 km using the model estimate approach), developed was 500 m (250 m using the model estimate approach), forest 250 m, grassland 500 m (1.25 km using the model estimate approach), and protected area 3.5 km (5 km using the model estimate approach, Figure \@ref(fig:scale).

Models that included both a land cover covariate and ownership generally performed better than either owner or land cover alone.
However, the best-performing model according to AIC was only grassland within 500 m (Table \@ref(tab:models)), although the goodness of fit (adjusted R-squared: `r mods.lc_summ$r2_adj[1]`) was equivalent to the second best model, which included owner and grassland within 500 m (ΔAIC = `r mods.lc_summ$deltaAIC[2]`).
For every 0.1 increase in proportion grassland within 500 m, obligate abundance increased by `r round(mods.lc[[12]] |> summary() |> broom::tidy() |> pull(estimate) |> pluck(2), 2)` individuals (Figure \@ref(fig:grass)).
Models including surrounding protected area, the log of the property acreage, development, or an interaction between ownership and either protected area or development were not competitive (i.e. ΔAIC \> 2).

# Discussion

<!-- Begin with a statement that summarizes the study’s main findings. Develop the significance and importance of the results and set them into a framework of previous research. Additional statistical tests and results are inappropriate here except in unusual cases. If you have a Conclusion section, list it as a subheading within the Discussion. -->

<!-- We predicted that (1) private easements and public lands would have higher grassland species richness, abundance, and diversity relative to unprotected private lands. NO! (2) the proportion of protected area in the surrounding landscape would increase richness, abundance, and diversity, and (3) that increased urbanization in the surrounding landscape would have a more negative impact on grassland bird abundance within private unprotected lands than within public lands.  -->

Here we assessed the impacts of land protection and public versus private ownership on eastern grassland bird populations.
In contrast to other research [@dettling2021], we did not observe a safeguarding effect of protected public lands on grassland bird richness, abundance, and diversity as compared to privately-owned and managed lands.
Public lands, despite being protected from development, do not necessarily carry a mandate for biodiversity protection [@pad].
Management priorities can vary within public lands, with some being devoted to historical and cultural goals, as in the national battlefield parks.
The compatibility of those priorities with grassland bird biodiversity will likely depend on the details and application of their management plans.
The higher richness of non-grassland species within public lands suggests that current management strategies may encourage more non-grassland species, even in the surveyed grassland locations.



We found support for the importance of existing grassland habitat while the ownership of that habitat was less influential.
Surrounding development appeared to have little impact except at the smallest spatial scales, suggesting that grassland habitat is valuable even in highly urbanized areas.
We also found no support for an interaction between protected status and development on grassland obligate abundance, contrary to our prediction that protected areas would have a stronger impact with more surrounding development.
Grassland birds are able to use and colonize even small patches [@weidman2011; @vickery1999], so their persistence even in close proximity to development is reasonable.
Although the results of a model containing protected area within 3.5 km were significant, that model performed far worse than a model containing only local grassland.
Other studies have found a safeguarding effect of public lands; for example, richness of grassland-specialist species increased with increasing proportion of CRP easements in the landscape [@pavlackyjr.2022].
However, other research has found lower species richness and diversity within protected areas [@rayner2013], largely due to the management and regional conservation policies in place in those protected areas.
These results suggest that local habitat management can overcome the differences between public and private lands, meaning partnerships between public and private lands will be key to conserving grassland birds.

Ultimately land ownership and protected status were less important than the local grassland habitat.
Although the top two models were within 2 AIC, that the top model did not include land ownership means that its inclusion in models of abundance is not justified [@arnold2010].
This, combined with the fact that grassland cover differed by ownership type, indicates that although there are observable patterns in abundance between landowners, ownership is likely not the true driver of these patterns.
Many grassland species are considered area-sensitive [@ribic2009], meaning they rely on contiguous grassland patches above species- or population-specific area thresholds.
Therefore, the apparent deficiencies of public lands for grassland birds can likely be overcome by changes in local habitat management such as increasing contiguous grassland area.

Grasshopper Sparrow has been proposed as an indicator species for dry upland prairie ecosystems [@elliott2018], although we found that its abundance did not reflect wider trends in eastern grassland birds.
Choosing one species to serve as an indicator for eastern grasslands is likely insufficient, because this highly abundant species was an outlier in its higher abundance on public lands.
Eastern Meadowlark, which was abundant overall but followed a similar pattern to other species with lower abundance on public lands, may show better ability to indicate the impact of management on grassland birds as a whole, especially if analyzed alongside Grasshopper Sparrow (see chapter 2).
Healthy populations are probably best indicated by high abundances of grassland birds rather than community diversity, although abundance is not necessarily an indicator of habitat quality [@vanhorne1983].
Further information on the reproduction of species within these habitats was not available, but would be beneficial to estimate reproductive rates on properties where long-term survey data is not available.

The types of lands sampled may have had an impact on the results.
Unprotected private lands surveyed through the Virginia Working Landscapes program may have been more likely than other private agricultural lands in the region to implement farming practices that reduce harm to grassland birds during the breeding season [@green2022].
Additionally, contrary to the typical methods of preservation embodied by the National Park Service, the battlefield parks maintain their cultural and historical goals through agricultural leases carried out by private operators [@nationalparkservice2020].

<!-- Next steps -->

Development of spatially-explicit models of grassland bird diversity that incorporate protected areas could help target conservation activity throughout the Piedmont region.
Such models can target areas with the most potential to increase abundance through additions of conservation easements on private land [@pavlackyjr.2022] or adoption of grassland bird-friendly management strategies on unprotected lands.
Additionally, these data represent a robust long-term monitoring effort within the region.
Comparing population trends by species with the North American Breeding Bird Survey or eBird could provide a more complete measure of the differences between specific ownership types and protections [@dettling2021].
Despite lower abundances, it may still be that birds within protected areas-- or even within well-managed unprotected areas-- are experiencing population declines of a less rapid rate than in the region as a whole.
