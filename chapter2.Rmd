# Abstract

<!-- The Abstract is perhaps the most important paragraph in a paper. Avoid writing it as a mere summary of the research. Place key results in the abstract’s first two sentences – don't bury the lede. Do not include lists of common methods, discursive explanations of what you set out to accomplish, or citations. Use the abstract and title to highlight the paper’s keywords. Maximum word count is 350.  -->


# Introduction

<!-- This section provides your research aims and significance and places it within the framework of the existing literature. The last Introduction paragraph typically provides the study’s hypotheses and testable predictions. Use citations judiciously; most points can be supported by three or fewer citations. Long lists of citations are seldom required and detract from the readability of the manuscript. -->

<!-- Biodiversity decline -->
Biodiversity loss is a pressing global issue driven by human modification of ecosystems, including habitat loss and degradation.
The expansion and intensification of agriculture are major contributors to biodiversity loss worldwide [@maxwell2016].
In North America, population declines of birds that rely on grassland habitats have been driven by these factors [@stanton2018; @hill2014], with a 53% decrease in populations since 1970 [@rosenberg2019].
These declines have made this guild a high priority for conservation efforts [@brennan2005].
The collapse of grassland bird populations has been particularly dramatic in the eastern US [@sauer2017], largely due to the loss of pasture and remaining historical grasslands to afforestation, development, and intensive agriculture [@brennan2005].

<!-- Protected areas -->
Protected areas are a vital strategy for maintaining biodiversity in the face of population declines.
These areas can be insulated from, though not immune to, surrounding sensory pollution [@buxton2017] and land-use changes [@andam2008].
Such insulation from the pressures of the surrounding human-dominated landscape can create a safeguarding effect where bird species show better long-term population growth rates inside protected areas than outside [@dettling2021].
However, publicly-owned lands are limited in extent and coverage of habitat types, often under-representing grassland species [@alexander2017; @grand2019].
The impact of protected areas on eastern grassland birds is under-studied; most indicators for the health of public lands in this region such as the Bird Community Index have focused on forest and edge species [@ladin2016; @oconnell1998; @canterbury2000; @goodwin2014].
Public lands are also faced by management challenges that can limit their effectiveness as protected areas.
For example, financial support for public lands has stagnated in the US in recent decades, leading to large management backlogs [@watson2014].
These backlogs can be particularly important in managing ephemeral grasslands that can require annual to biannual disturbance to remain suitable habitat for species of concern.
At a global scale, protected areas have fallen short of target goals set by the Convention on Biological Diversity [@watson2014].
Although important, protected areas alone are not sufficient to conserve biodiversity.

<!-- Private areas, esp for grasslands -->
Privately-owned lands are also essential for conservation, and integrating public and private lands is necessary to conserve grassland birds.
The majority of land in the US is privately owned, and roughly 52% of land in the US is used for agricultural production [@usdaers].
Many grassland species are considered area-sensitive, so increasing the total area of protected grassland will be necessary to conserve them.
However, area alone is not sufficient to protect grassland bird populations in agricultural landscapes when land management degrades habitat [@with2008], and even small patches can be beneficial to grassland bird populations when managed with bird conservation in mind [@weidman2011].
A patchwork of agricultural and working lands provide human needs through agriculture and can function complementary to protected areas in the maintenance of biodiversity [@kremen2018].
Agricultural practices meant to preserve wildlife and spare land from production can result in both high crop yield and grassland ecosystem functioning [@green2005].
Working lands can have same community composition as protected areas, though this effect has been shown most strongly in agroforestry [@karp2019].
Individual management decisions on unprotected working lands, often motivated by the need for yield and annual fluctuations in climate, have the power to drive grassland bird populations at a regional scale [@allen2021].
However, management practices that favor grassland birds are often more expensive, leading to lack of widespread adoption [@atwood2017; @troy2005].

Land easements are one strategy to promote wildlife-friendly land use on private lands.
These can take the form of land-sparing agreements and cost-sharing programs that encourage the adoption of certain management practices.
Conservation easements can provide equal or superior ecosystem services as protected public lands [@villamagna2015] and protect grassland habitat from conversion to degrading land use [@claassen2017].
One form of easement is the US Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which removes cropland from production through limited-term voluntary conservation easements on private lands.
A large body of research suggests that these easements can host high populations of regionally declining grassland species [@johnson1993; @johnson1993a; @ribic2009a; @herkert2009].
CRP easements on private lands can even outperform protected public lands and unprotected private lands for grassland birds [@cunningham2005; @best1997; @ahlering2019].

<!-- Local to regional indicators for grassland health -->
Public lands, alongside conservation measures such as CRP enrollment, cost-share practices, and prairie restoration, can have impacts from the local [@allen2019] to regional [@allen2021] to landscape scale [@pavlackyjr.2022; @veech2006].
There are many potential scales over which land use and land protection could impact grassland bird communities, so determining the scale of effect, that is, the scale at which communities respond most strongly to the metric, is crucial [@miguet2016].
We surveyed bird communities in Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia to evaluate the relative contributions of protected areas and private land at local and regional scales for grassland bird conservation.
These areas were monitored as part of two separate projects conducted by the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program (NPS I&M) and the Smithsonian's Virginia Working Landscapes (VWL), a voluntary conservation program. 
We hypothesized that protected areas can safeguard grassland bird diversity in this region. 
We predicted that 
(1) private easements and public lands would have higher grassland species richness, abundance, and diversity relative to unprotected private lands, 
(2) the proportion of protected area in the surrounding landscape would increase richness, abundance, and diversity, and 
(3) that increased urbanization in the surrounding landscape would have a more negative impact on birds on private unprotected lands than on birds on public lands.

## Monitoring programs

We pooled data from two breeding-season bird monitoring programs: one conducted entirely on public lands within NPS and one conducted on a mix of public and private lands throughout the region by VWL.
The NPS I&M has collected forest bird occurrence and abundance data in the National Capital Region since 2007 [@nationalparkservice2005] and in 2014 initiated long-term population monitoring for grassland birds.
In total, the combined dataset consisted of 760 points on 143 properties.
NPS I&M surveys occurred between 2014-2019 and in 2021 at 242 points on four national battlefield parks in northern Virginia, central Maryland, and eastern West Virginia.
VWL conducted surveys at 518 points on 140 properties from 2012-2022.
Both programs conducted surveys at Manassas National Battlefield Park in Manassas, Virginia.
NPS points were surveyed annually (range: 3-7 years) while VWL points were typically only visited in one year (range: 1-3 years).
NPS-surveyed properties were more densely-surveyed (range: 29-100 points per property), while VWL-surveyed properties were less so (range: 1-21 points per property).

Survey methods were sufficiently similar between these two programs.
Point counts consisted of a 10 minute count conducted by a single observer (though VWL surveys also typically had a non-observer scribe present) from 30 minutes before sunrise until 5 hours after sunrise.
Observers performed a fixed-radius count, recording birds within 100 m.
Birds observed outside of this time and distance window were designated as incidentals and were excluded from analysis.
The two programs differed in their coding of weather conditions and subdivisions of time and distance bands, which were not relevant for this analysis.

## Analysis

We used the USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States version 3.0 [@pad] to assign each survey point a classification as public land (overlapping a protected area owned by federal, state, or local government, or an NGO), private easement (overlapping a protected area owned privately), or private unprotected (no overlap with protected areas). 
To examine the impact of land cover and protected area cover at multiple spatial scales, we extracted the proportion of protected area coverage alongside the proportion of different land cover types [@nlcd2019] at buffer radii ranging from 200 m to 10 km.
We reclassified land cover into two types: forest (consisting of deciduous, evergreen, mixed forest, and woody wetlands) and developed (consisting of low,  medium, and high-intensity urban cover). 
These two types of land cover are known to have impacts on grassland species [@irvin2013; @buxton2016].
<!-- We also calculated the contiguous area of the protected area in which each public or private easement point was located. -->

We classified species as obligate and facultative grassland-breeders following @vickery1999 (Table \@ref(tab:species)). 
We calculated average abundance per survey of facultative and obligate grassland species. 
We calculated mean annual grassland species richness by point. 
To prevent differences in sampling intensity form influencing richness, we used only 3 visits per point and did not pool data across years because points in the NPS data set would have inevitably had a higher richness due to singleton rarities accumulated over multiple years of surveys at each point.
We calculated the Shannon index (commonly referred to as diversity, but see @jost2006) of grassland species in each ownership type using the R package "vegan" [@oksanen2022]. 
We transformed Shannon index into Hill number to get an effective number of species [@jost2006].
The advantage of Hill numbers is that they can be effectively compared and obey an intuitive doubling property that accurately reflects proportional differences in assemblies [@chao2014].
We compared abundance and richness among ownership types using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
With significant ANOVA results (*P*<0.05), we performed Tukey post-hoc pairwise  comparisons of abundance and richness.

We modeled Hill number and total grassland species abundance as a function of proportion land cover.
We ranked models using Akaike's information criteria AIC [@akaike1974], comparing to a static null model and one with only land ownership.
To investigate the safeguarding effect of public lands, we also investigated whether ownership type had an interactive effect on
All analyses were performed using program R version 4.1.2 [@rcoreteam2022].

# Results

<!-- Include only results pertinent to the hypotheses being tested or questions raised in the Introduction section and treated in the Discussion. Use the same number of decimal places for means and estimates of uncertainty (e.g., 38.9 ± 1.2, not 38.9 ± 1.23); usually only one or two decimal places are necessary. Round percentages to whole numbers. The text should not duplicate material presented in tables or figures. Clearly present relevant sample sizes, degrees of freedom, values of statistical tests, and P-values. Test statistics should be rounded to one (t-test, C2, F, etc.) or two (r, r2, etc.) decimal places. See Statistical Details in the Style Sheet for more information. -->

## Public vs private context

Points located within public lands and easements had higher proportion of surrounding protected area at small spatial scales due to their placement within such protected areas (Figure \@ref(fig:protradius)).
However, at the largest spatial scales, points were not surrounded by as much protection.
The proportion of protected area within 8 km differed by land ownership type (*F~(2,757)~* = 44.0, *P*<0.001).
At this scale, points on public lands were surrounded by less protected area than those on private easements (*P*<0.001) or private unprotected lands (*P*=0.01).

## Richness, abundance, diversity

While public lands had a slightly higher pooled grassland species richness (21 spp.) than private easements (19 spp.) or private unprotected land (17 spp.), annual richness per point per year (standardized for effort at 3 surveys per point per year) of all grassland species did not differ significantly by landowner type according to a one-way ANOVA (*F~(2,2075)~*=2.93, *P*=0.053; Figure \@ref(fig:richptyr)).
We were interested in whether obligate species would respond more strongly than facultative species, given their stricter reliance on grassland habitat.
Public lands had slightly lower richness of obligate (*P*=0.02) and facultative (*P*=0.03) species than private easements when those groups were considered alone (Figure \@ref(fig:richptyr)).
Richness did not differ between private easements and private unprotected lands for obligate (*P*=0.91) or facultative (*P*=0.70) species.

Mean abundance of grassland species was variable, with the most abundant obligates being Grasshopper Sparrow and Eastern Meadowlark (Figure \@ref(fig:abundbysurvey)).
Together, these two species made up 33% of all individual grassland birds that were detected.
Certain species (Loggerhead Shrike, Northern Harrier, Mallard, Dickcissel) were so rare that fewer than 20 individuals were observed across more than 6,000 surveys.

# Discussion

<!-- Begin with a statement that summarizes the study’s main findings. Develop the significance and importance of the results and set them into a framework of previous research. Additional statistical tests and results are inappropriate here except in unusual cases. If you have a Conclusion section, list it as a subheading within the Discussion. -->

Farms enrolled in a voluntary conservation initiative are not the best sample of private unprotected lands in the region.
Farming was conducted on parkland, making it atypical to NPS's mission of preservation.

<!-- Next steps -->
Development of spatially-explicit models of grassland bird diversity for this region that incorporate protected areas could help target conservation activity throughout the Piedmont region.
